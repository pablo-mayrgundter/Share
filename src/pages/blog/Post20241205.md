## Pioneering a New Wave in Open-Source Design & Engineering Collaboration

Bldrs is thrilled to unveil Share and its Conway Engine, a powerful web application
crafted for high-performance CAD collaboration in contemporary engineering workflows.
These tools are the result of years of intensive research, development, and engineering,
marking the official launch of Bldrsâ€™ open-source and commercial strategy.

### Why Bldrs Share & Conway Engine?

Engineering teams in the built world have been tethered to outdated desktop CAD tools,
proprietary formats, and sluggish SaaS solutions. Drawing on our decades of experience in
software innovation, Bldrs introduces a browser-first, real-time collaboration platform that
supports federated versioning, open-source, and open-standard toolingâ€”tailored for modern
workflows and designed for architects, engineers, industrial designers, manufacturers, and
operators leading the worldâ€™s most impactful projects.

Share and Conway Engine are designed to help builder communities overcome the collaboration
limitations common in current CAD tools. Modern cross-functional teams require frictionless,
high-performance web-based visualization, real-time collaboration, visual issue tracking and
seamless integration with automation.  Regardless of your discipline, Share and Conway Engine
unlock a new level of capability in CAD model sharing.

As an open-source project, Share will remain accessible, customizable, and adaptable for
all users, from independent creators to large-scale enterprise teams.
We invite the community to share feedback, collaborate, and shape the future of these tools to
Build Every Thing Together.
